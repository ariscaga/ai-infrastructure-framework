## What is SCALE FACTOR™?

SCALE FACTOR™ is a diagnostic methodology designed to help startups, SMEs, and portfolio companies understand how prepared their organizational infrastructure is for AI-driven scaling. It measures capability and risk across five core dimensions:

- **S — Systems Coherence:** Alignment, integration, and interoperability across tools and data  
- **C — Customer Experience Integrity:** Ability to maintain service quality as automation increases  
- **A — AI Strategy Alignment:** Prioritization of high-impact use cases, feasibility, and ROI  
- **L — Leadership Infrastructure:** Decision workflows, governance, and operating models  
- **E — Enterprise Readiness:** Operational, financial, and technical foundations for scale  

Two extended dimensions also assess integration maturity and workflow adaptability.

## How It Works

The assessment produces a SCALE FACTOR™ score (1.0–3.0) through:

1. **User Type Selection** → Portfolio Manager or Founder/Executive  
2. **Seven Strategic Questions** → Covering infrastructure, systems health, and AI readiness  
3. **Real-Time Scoring** → Quantitative output across all dimensions  
4. **Zone Classification** → Break Risk / Unstable Scale / Enterprise-Ready  
5. **Risk Modeling** → Potential cost of operational friction  
6. **Action Recommendations** → Immediate and longer-term priorities

## Scoring Zones

| SCALE FACTOR™ | Zone | Risk Level | What It Indicates |
|--------------|------|------------|-------------------|
| **1.0–1.4** | 🚨 Break Risk | High | Infrastructure gaps will constrain growth |
| **1.5–2.4** | ⚠️ Unstable Scale | Moderate | Scaling possible with targeted optimization |
| **2.5–3.0** | ✅ Enterprise-Ready | Low | Strong foundation for accelerated AI adoption |
