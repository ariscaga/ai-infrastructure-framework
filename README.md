## What is SCALE FACTOR™?

SCALE FACTOR™ is a diagnostic framework that evaluates an organization's readiness to scale with modern AI infrastructure. It measures capability across the five core SCALE dimensions:

- **S**ystems Coherence — Alignment and integration of tools and data
- **C**ustomer Experience Integrity — Maintaining quality as systems scale
- **A**I Strategy Alignment — Prioritizing high-impact use cases and feasibility
- **L**eadership Infrastructure — Systems, decision workflows, and governance
- **E**nterprise Readiness — Operational and financial readiness for growth

The framework also incorporates two extended dimensions covering integration maturity and workflow adaptability.

## How It Works

1. **User Type Selection** → Portfolio Manager or Founder/Executive  
2. **7 Strategic Questions** → Covering all readiness dimensions  
3. **Real-time Scoring** → Produces a SCALE FACTOR™ from 1.0 to 3.0  
4. **Zone Classification**  
5. **Risk Assessment**  
6. **Recommended Actions** → Immediate and strategic steps

## Scoring Zones

| SCALE FACTOR™ | Zone | Risk Level | Meaning |
|--------------|------|------------|---------|
| 1.0–1.4 | 🚨 Break Risk | High | Infrastructure gaps will impede scaling |
| 1.5–2.4 | ⚠️ Unstable Scale | Moderate | Scaling possible with optimization |
| 2.5–3.0 | ✅ Enterprise-Ready | Low | Strong foundation for AI-driven growth |
